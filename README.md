# Advanced Music Player with PyQt5

This repository contains the files for the Advanced Music Player with PyQt5 posted on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel.

This project started out life as a FreeCodeCamp repo, which included 2 UI files and various images for the backgrounds and buttons.
I'm building this project to learn how Qt5 works and practice working with UI. While this isn't an AI project, I hope to use what 
I am learning to create GUIs for some of my AI projects.
